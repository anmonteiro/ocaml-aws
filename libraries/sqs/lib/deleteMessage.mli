(** "<p>Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to delete, use the <code>ReceiptHandle</code> of the message (<i>not</i> the <code>MessageId</code> which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue. </p> <note> <p>The <code>ReceiptHandle</code> is associated with a <i>specific instance</i> of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the <code>ReceiptHandle</code> is different each time you receive a message. When you use the <code>DeleteMessage</code> action, you must provide the most recently received <code>ReceiptHandle</code> for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message might not be deleted).</p> <p>For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.</p> </note>" *)
