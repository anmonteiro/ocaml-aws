(** "<p>Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3</p> <p>This operation performs the following types of requests: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>select</code> - Perform a select query on an archived object</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>restore an archive</code> - Restore an archived object</p> </li> </ul> <p>To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the <code>s3:RestoreObject</code> and <code>s3:GetObject</code> actions. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources\">Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html\">Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Querying Archives with Select Requests</b> </p> <p>You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html\">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>When making a select request, do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html\">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about the <code>S3</code> structure in the request body, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>PutObject</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Managing Access with ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Define the SQL expression for the <code>SELECT</code> type of restoration for your query in the request body's <code>SelectParameters</code> structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The following expression returns all records from the specified object.</p> <p> <code>SELECT * FROM Object</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.</p> <p> <code>SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>If you have headers and you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> in the <code>CSV</code> structure in the request body to <code>USE</code>, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> field to <code>IGNORE</code>, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names. </p> <p> <code>SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s</code> </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about using SQL with Glacier Select restore, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html\">SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and Glacier Select</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>When making a select request, you can also do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To expedite your queries, specify the <code>Expedited</code> tier. For more information about tiers, see \"Restoring Archives,\" later in this topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The following are additional important facts about the select feature:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.</p> </li> <li> <p> Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn\226\128\153t return error response <code>409</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Restoring Archives</b> </p> <p>Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from. </p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being restored from and which data access tier you specify. </p> <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1\226\128\1475 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier\226\128\153s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html\">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing another restore request to the same object, setting a new <code>Tier</code> request element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters, such as the <code>Days</code> request element. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html\"> Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html\">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see <a>PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">Object Lifecycle Management</a> in <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Responses</b> </p> <p>A successful operation returns either the <code>200 OK</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code> status code. </p> <ul> <li> <p>If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns <code>202 Accepted</code> in the response. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> in the response. </p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"title\"> <b>Special Errors</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p class=\"title\"> <b/> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress</i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Cause: Object restore is already in progress.
